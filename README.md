## About this repository
This repository contains small, mostly unfinished games that I have created around 2018 that use Xai Game Engine, and the engine itself. In the first games the engine is hardcoded, as it was created via evolution process.

### Xai Game Engine
XGE is a very simple object oriented game engine. Main concepts include:
- inheritable GameObject class
- changeable stages
- constant size list (!) of game objects per stage. You cannot change this list while the stage is running
- various bugs and stupid decisions
- semi rushed code

### Games included

1. Space-Invader-Clone
 The reason why this engine exists. Shoot asteroids until they die.
